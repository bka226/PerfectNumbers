# PerfectNumbers
An integer number is said to be a perfect numberif its factors, including 1 
(but not the number itself) sum to the number.  For example, 6 is a perfect number, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. 
(The factorization of 6 is 1*2*3, so the sum of the factors of the number 6 is 6).   
the methodd determines whether a parameter numberis a perfect number and displays all perfect numbers between 1 and 1000.
